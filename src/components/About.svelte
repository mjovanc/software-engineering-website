		The community was founded on September 7, 2023, by Marcus Cvjeticanin. Initially, the goal was to create a dedicated space for backend engineers, as there was a lack of actively moderated communities for them at the time.
		As the community grew to 1,000 members, the idea emerged to broaden its scope to include a wider range of engineering disciplines. This led to renaming the community to "Software Engineering" to cover more topics and welcome more people.

		The communities feature on 𝕏 is still new and evolving rapidly with exciting updates. Our community is actively collaborating with the developers of 𝕏 to provide feedback and request new features that our members are eager to see. We are just at the beginning.
